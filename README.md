# Battery Status
Displays the current power level of the battery in Atom's status bar, and
indicates if the battery is currently charging. Especially useful if you often
work in full-screen mode on your laptop!

## Known issues
Since I'm using the [node-battery](https://github.com/leon-vv/node-battery/)
module here, this package cannot display the battery status on operating
systems other than linux or osx. If you have any ideas on how to fix this,
contact the owner of that package or tell me if there's a package that already
works everywhere that I didn't find!

If you'd like to have some configuration options, just drop a feature request
and I'll look into it.
